# MOTION-PLANNING-USING-Potential_field--Voronoi_diagram--trapezoidal_decomposition

In this project, 3 Algorithms for motion planning were implemented:

 1. Artificial Potential Field

 2. Generalized Voronoi Diagram

 3. Trapezoidal Decomposition

Simulation for all the 3 were performed in ROS_GAZEBO using turtlebot burger.
